# Supermarket-Simulator
This java-program simulates a supermarket and a simulator that are seperate from eachother to calculate the best amount of cash registers given different inputs such as,
amount of max cash registers, max customers that can be in simultaneously, arrival speed and so on. The main point of the simulation is to use different algorithms to determine
the lowest possible cash registers to handle all the customers while losing the minimum amount of customers.
