[`Betalning.java`](file:///src/snabbkÃ¶p/kunder/betalning.java) works almost now, it runs with the next customers ID. Once the `betalning` event is instantiated if there is no available cash registers, the event stored in the `EventQueue`. However it stays there even if a new cash register becomes available.
